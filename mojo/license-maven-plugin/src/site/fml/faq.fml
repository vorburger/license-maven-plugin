    <faq id="google-code-maven-license-plugin">
      <question>What is the difference between this plugin (the Codehaus license-maven-plugin) and the maven-license-plugin hosted at Google Code?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The Codehaus plugin and the <a href="">Google Code</a> plugin were developed separately but with similar goals.  
          The two plugins have several overlapping features including verifying and updating license information in 
          source files.  The Codehaus plugin also provides the ability to download the licenses of thirdparty dependencies 
          and create and XML report listing each project dependency and its license.  If you are not sure which one to use
          you should try both to see which one better fits your needs.

    <faq id="code-lutin-maven-license-plugin">
      <question>What is the difference between this plugin (the Codehaus license-maven-plugin) and the maven-license-plugin hosted at Code Lutin?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://maven-site.nuiton.org/maven-license-plugin/">Code Lutin maven-license-plugin</a> is an older version of the Codehaus license-maven-plugin.  The source code 
          of the Code Lutin plugin was donated to Codehaus and merged with some existing license plugin code.
          His original creator joined then the Codehaus team to continue the project developement.

    <faq id="mysql-file-header">
          <question>Why sql style should not be used with mysql sql files ?</question>
          <answer>
            <p>
              Mysql does not accept <strong>---</strong> as comment (which is used to mark license header for normal sql files).
              You should use the <i>mysql</i> header style instead, with with configuration:
              <pre>
              &lt;extraExtensions&gt;
              &lt;sql&gt;mysql&lt;/sql&gt;
              &lt;/extraExtensions&gt;
              </pre>
